# Donation QR Code Image

To enable the donation QR code in the support modal, please add a file named `donate.jpg` to this `public` folder.

The image should be:
- A QR code for your payment/donation method
- Recommended size: 250x250px or larger (square format)
- Format: JPG, PNG, or any web-compatible image format

The support button will automatically display this image when users click the "Support" button. If the image is not found, a placeholder message will be shown instead.
